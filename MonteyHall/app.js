// MONTY HALL PROBLEM

// Two contestants are playing a game. There are three boxes, two empty and one containing Â£100,000.
// The contestants chose a box, the quizmaster removes an empty box from the remaining two boxes.
// The contestants are then given a choice to either stick with their first choise or switch to the other box.
// In this example, one contestant always sticks and the other always switches. Who wins more games?

// Variables for win / lose tallies
